This is the source for the firmware for TellStick Duo.
The firmware must be compiled on a Linux machine.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software is required to build the firmware for TellStick Net.

* Hi-Tech C Pro for the PIC18 MCU Family, version 9.63PL3 or later.
  http://www.htsoft.com

* CMake version 2.8.0 or later
  http://www.cmake.org

* Git
  http://git-scm.com

Prepare the source
------------------

Check out the source from the Telldus repository. We use submodules so
they must also be initialized.

  git clone http://git.telldus.com/tellstick-duo.git
	cd tellstick-duo
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Compile the source
------------------

We recommend you do an "out of source" build. Create a folder and
initiate a cmake build cache in it.

  mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../firmware -DPICC18_PATH=<path to picc18>

Now build the source.
  make
